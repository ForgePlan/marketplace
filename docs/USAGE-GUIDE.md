## How It All Fits Together

ForgePlan ecosystem has 4 systems, each at its own level:

```
Orchestra    — WHERE is the task?  (tracking, sync, inbox)
Forgeplan    — WHAT to do?         (PRD, evidence, lifecycle)
FPF          — HOW to think?       (decompose, evaluate, reason)
SPARC        — HOW to code?        (spec → pseudo → arch → refine → complete)
```

No overlaps — each system does one thing well, all complement each other.

### Typical workflow

```
1. forgeplan route "task"      → determines depth (Tactical/Standard/Deep)
2. forgeplan new prd "task"    → describes WHAT to build
3. /fpf decompose              → breaks the problem into bounded parts
4. /sprint Deep                → SPARC phases: Spec → Pseudo → Arch → Refine
   ↳ agents from installed packs do the work
5. /audit                      → reviewers check the result
6. forgeplan new evidence      → documents what was verified
7. Commit → PR → Merge
```

### What each plugin provides

| Layer | Plugin | What you get |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Tracking** | forgeplan-orchestra | `/sync`, `/session`, Orchestra inbox |
| **Lifecycle** | forgeplan-workflow | `/forge-cycle`, `/forge-audit`, methodology KB |
| **Thinking** | fpf | `/fpf decompose/evaluate/reason`, 224 FPF sections |
| **Coding** | agents-sparc | SPARC orchestrator + 4 phase agents |
| **Universal tools** | dev-toolkit | `/audit`, `/sprint`, `/recall`, safety hooks |
| **UX** | laws-of-ux | `/ux-review`, `/ux-law`, 30 UX laws |
| **Agents** | agents-core/domain/pro/github | 55 specialized agents |

You can install any subset — each plugin works independently.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Plugin | What it does |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `/recall` | dev-toolkit | Restore session context (git + CLAUDE.md + memory) |
| `/sprint <task>` | dev-toolkit | Adaptive sprint: Tactical→Standard→Deep |
| `/audit` | dev-toolkit | Multi-expert code review (4 parallel agents) |
| `/fpf <question>` | fpf | Structured reasoning: decompose, evaluate, reason, lookup |
| `/ux-review` | laws-of-ux | UX audit against 30 Laws of UX |
| `/ux-law <name>` | laws-of-ux | Look up a specific UX law |
| `/forge-cycle` | forgeplan-workflow | Full dev cycle (route→shape→build→evidence→activate) |
| `/forge-audit` | forgeplan-workflow | Multi-expert audit (6 agents) |
| `/sync` | forgeplan-orchestra | Bidirectional sync Forgeplan ↔ Orchestra |
| `/session` | forgeplan-orchestra | Session Start Protocol with Inbox Pattern |

---

## Daily Workflow

### Morning — restore context

```
/recall
```

Shows: current branch, uncommitted changes, recent commits, project health.

### Before a task — think first

```
/fpf decompose our payment system     # break into parts
/fpf evaluate Redis vs Memcached      # compare options
/fpf reason why tests are flaky       # structured debugging
```

### Implementation — adaptive sprint

```
/sprint add user authentication
```

The sprint auto-detects scale:

| Scale | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Tactical** (typo, config) | 1 agent, quick waves, run tests |
| **Standard** (feature, 1-3 days) | ADI checkpoint, 2 agents, lint + types + test |
| **Deep** (module, architecture) | Mandatory ADI, 3-4 agents, full pipeline + release |

### After coding — verify

```
/audit
```

4 agents check in parallel: logic, architecture, security, tests. Reports findings as CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with file:line references.

### Frontend — UX check

```
/ux-review                    # scan all frontend files
/ux-law fitts                 # look up Fitts's Law (44px targets)
/ux-law hick                  # look up Hick's Law (7 nav items max)
```

## What to Add to CLAUDE.md

Add this block to your project's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Commands

| Command | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/recall` | Start of session — restore context |
| `/sprint <task>` | Implement a feature (auto-scales) |
| `/audit` | After writing code — multi-expert review |
| `/fpf <question>` | Architecture decisions, comparisons, debugging |
| `/ux-review` | After frontend work — UX law compliance |
```

If using Forgeplan:

```markdown
## Forgeplan Workflow

- `forgeplan route "task"` before coding → determine depth
- `/forge-cycle` → full cycle (health→route→shape→build→evidence→activate)
- `/sync` → sync Forgeplan artifacts ↔ Orchestra tasks
- `/session` → Session Start Protocol with Inbox triage
```

## Hook Behavior

When you install multiple plugins, their hooks stack — each fires independently.

### What fires when

| Event | Plugins | Hook | What it does |
|-------|---------|------|-------------|
| `PreToolUse:Bash` | dev-toolkit | safety-hook.sh | Blocks dangerous commands (force push, rm -rf /, DROP TABLE) |
| `PreToolUse:Bash` | forgeplan-workflow | forge-safety-hook.sh | Delegates to dev-toolkit if installed, otherwise runs own checks |
| `PreToolUse:Write` | forgeplan-workflow | pre-code-check.sh | Warns if no active PRD (cached, 5-min TTL) |
| `PostToolUse:Write\|Edit` | dev-toolkit | test-hint.sh | Suggests tests when new public functions are added |
| `PostToolUse:Write\|Edit` | laws-of-ux | ux-hint.sh | Suggests UX review when frontend files are modified |
| `PostToolUse:Bash` | forgeplan-orchestra | forge-sync-hint.sh | Suggests Orchestra sync after forgeplan activate/new |

### If both dev-toolkit and forgeplan-workflow are installed

Both have safety hooks on `PreToolUse:Bash`. The dev-toolkit hook runs first. The forgeplan-workflow hook detects dev-toolkit is installed and skips (exit 0) to avoid double-checking.

### Disabling a hook temporarily

Hooks cannot be disabled per-session. To disable a plugin's hooks, uninstall the plugin:
```
/plugin uninstall <plugin-name>@ForgePlan-marketplace
```

## Recommended Stacks

| Stack | Plugins | Best for |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Minimal** | dev-toolkit | Any project, zero dependencies |
| **Frontend** | dev-toolkit + laws-of-ux | Frontend/UI development |
| **FPF Thinker** | dev-toolkit + fpf | Architecture, decisions, reasoning |
| **Forgeplan User** | forgeplan-workflow + fpf | Forgeplan CLI users |
| **Full Stack** | all 5 plugins | ForgePlan power users with Orchestra |

---

## Dependency Requirements

| Plugin | Required | Optional |
|--------|----------|----------|
| laws-of-ux | None | — |
| dev-toolkit | None | Hindsight MCP (for /recall memory), forgeplan CLI (for /sprint scale detection) |
| fpf | None | forgeplan CLI (for artifact suggestions) |
| forgeplan-workflow | forgeplan CLI | dev-toolkit (shared safety hooks) |
| forgeplan-orchestra | forgeplan CLI + Orchestra MCP | Hindsight MCP (for /session memory recall) |

---

## Advisor Agents

Each of the 5 original plugins includes a background advisor agent:

| Plugin | Advisor | What it does |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| dev-toolkit | dev-advisor | Suggests /audit after changes, test reminders, security warnings, SPARC for complex tasks |
| forgeplan-workflow | forge-advisor | Suggests forgeplan route before coding, evidence after implementation, SPARC for Deep tasks |
| fpf | fpf-advisor | Suggests /fpf decompose, evaluate, reason for complex decisions |
| laws-of-ux | ux-reviewer | Reviews frontend code against 30 Laws of UX |
| forgeplan-orchestra | orchestra-advisor | Suggests Orchestra sync after forgeplan actions |

Advisors activate automatically — you don't need to invoke them. They observe your work and offer suggestions when relevant.

---

## Agent Packs

5 agent plugins provide 55 specialized agents:

| Pack | Agents | Use case |
|------|:------:|---------|
| agents-core (11) | debugger, code-reviewer, error-detective, performance-engineer, production-validator, coder, planner, researcher, reviewer, tester, tdd-london | Core development workflow |
| agents-domain (11) | typescript-pro, type-auditor, golang-pro, frontend-dev, nextjs-dev, electron-pro, embedded-systems, fullstack-dev, game-dev, mobile-dev, websocket-engineer | Language/framework specialists |
| agents-pro (21) | security-expert, injection-analyst, pii-detector, claims-authorizer, architect-reviewer, microservices-architect, ddd-domain-expert, adr-architect, distributed-systems-expert, goal-planner, ui-designer, prompt-engineer, documentation-engineer, api-docs-engineer, research-analyst, search-specialist, ml-developer, code-analyzer, memory-specialist, mcp-developer, platform-engineer | Professional specialists |
| agents-github (7) | pr-manager, issue-manager, release-manager, multi-repo-manager, project-board-manager, workflow-engineer, repo-architect | GitHub operations |
| agents-sparc (5) | sparc-orchestrator, specification, pseudocode, architecture, refinement | SPARC development methodology |

Install: `/plugin install agents-core@ForgePlan-marketplace`

---

## How Agents Work

Agents are invoked automatically by Claude when a task matches their expertise. You can also request a specific agent:

```
"Use the security-expert agent to review this code"
"Spawn the typescript-pro agent for this TypeScript refactoring"
```

### SPARC Methodology

When /sprint detects a Deep task and agents-sparc is installed, it uses SPARC phases:
1. Specification — requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Pseudocode — algorithms and data structures
3. Architecture — system design and file structure
4. Refinement — TDD and implementation
5. Completion — integration and PR

Each phase has a quality gate. The next phase receives FULL output of all previous phases.

---

## Advisor Agents

Each of the 5 original plugins includes a background advisor agent that activates automatically:

| Plugin | Advisor | What it does |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| dev-toolkit | `dev-advisor` | Suggests `/audit` after changes, test reminders, security warnings, SPARC for complex tasks, agent pack recommendations |
| forgeplan-workflow | `forge-advisor` | Suggests `forgeplan route` before coding, evidence after implementation, SPARC for Deep tasks |
| fpf | `fpf-advisor` | Suggests `/fpf decompose`, `evaluate`, `reason` for complex decisions |
| laws-of-ux | `ux-reviewer` | Reviews frontend code against 30 Laws of UX when UI files are modified |
| forgeplan-orchestra | `orchestra-advisor` | Suggests Orchestra sync after `forgeplan activate` or `forgeplan new` |

You don't need to invoke advisors — they observe your work and offer suggestions when relevant.

---

## Agent Packs

5 agent plugins provide 55 specialized agents you can install separately:

| Pack | Install | Agents | Use case |
|------|---------|:------:|---------|
| **agents-core** | `/plugin install agents-core@ForgePlan-marketplace` | 11 | Core: debugger, code-reviewer, planner, tester, coder, researcher, reviewer |
| **agents-domain** | `/plugin install agents-domain@ForgePlan-marketplace` | 11 | Language specialists: TypeScript, Go, React, Next.js, Electron, mobile |
| **agents-pro** | `/plugin install agents-pro@ForgePlan-marketplace` | 21 | Security, architecture, DDD, creative, research, infrastructure |
| **agents-github** | `/plugin install agents-github@ForgePlan-marketplace` | 7 | GitHub: PR, issues, releases, multi-repo, project boards, workflows |
| **agents-sparc** | `/plugin install agents-sparc@ForgePlan-marketplace` | 5 | SPARC methodology: orchestrator + 4 phase specialists |

---

## How Agents Work

Agents are invoked by Claude automatically when a task matches their expertise. You can also request a specific agent:

```
"Use the security-expert agent to review this auth code"
"Spawn typescript-pro for this TypeScript refactoring"
"Run the debugger agent on this error"
```

### SPARC Methodology

When `/sprint` detects a **Deep** task and `agents-sparc` is installed, it uses SPARC phases:

1. **Specification** → requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Pseudocode** → algorithms and data structures
3. **Architecture** → system design and file structure
4. **Refinement** → TDD and implementation
5. **Completion** → integration and PR

Each phase has a **quality gate**. The next phase receives full output of all previous phases — this prevents inconsistencies between phases.

Three execution modes (auto-detected):
- **Mode A** (Sequential): agents-sparc installed → phases run one by one
- **Mode B** (Team-up): TeamCreate available → phases as team with dependencies
- **Mode C** (Inline): no plugins → Claude executes phases itself

## Troubleshooting

### Plugins not loading after install

```
/reload-plugins
/doctor          # check for errors
```

### Hooks are noisy (showing messages on every edit)

Update to v1.1.1+: hooks use `type: "command"` (silent scripts) instead of `type: "prompt"`.

```
/plugin marketplace update ForgePlan-marketplace
/plugin install <plugin>@ForgePlan-marketplace
/reload-plugins
```

### Marketplace name error on macOS

Use exact case: `ForgePlan/marketplace` (capital F and P). macOS APFS case-insensitive + Node.js fs.rename requires matching case.
